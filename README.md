#Games README

This is a website that will store different games I've coded.

To access any of the games, just click on the image or name of the game

**Connect 4**
    1. Connect 4 was created between December 2022 - January 2023 while in FullStack Academy's Boot Camp as a basic web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    2. Connect 4 is a strategic game akin to tic-tac-toe, played on a 7x6 vertical board. The goal is to achieve 4 in a row, whether vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. Currently, you can play against an easy computer, or you can play against a friend. You click the buttons below the columns to place a token. While in session, the website keeps track of yellow wins and red wins.
    3. Challenges I faced were being new to coding and trying to figure out the best practices while making a working product.
    4. Next for this game is to first convert it into a React app for better integration with this whole project. Then from there, I will need to update functionality, especially as I have grown in my own coding since completing this game. This updated functionality will include making the 'Easy Computer' actually play the game and then creating an algorithm for the 'Hard Computer'. Then I will also convert the existing CSS into TailwindCSS. Finally, I will develop a better system for keeping track of wins.

**Unruly**
    1. Unruly was created between July - August 2023 as a React app using TailwindCSS
    2. Unruly is a game I found from Simon Tatham's Puzzles, an app for Android and iPhone. When given a board, you fill it in by clicking on a square to change the colors between black, white, and clear. The goal is to fill the board with black and white squares while ensuring two parameters are met: all rows and columns have an equal number of black and white squares and there are no more than two consecutive squares of the same color.
    3. Challenges I faced were working to try to get a random board generated, checking the parameters, and making sure my TailwindCSS worked the way I wanted it to. My parameters and TailwindCSS are working as expected. However, I still have issues with randomly generating a board. So I used the app and hardcoded in a set of pregenerated boards that will randomly get picked.
    4. Next for this game will be to incorporate different sized boards. Then continuing working on the random board generator.

Some other game ideas I am thinking about coding include: Minesweeper, Snake, Cribbage, Tic-Tac-Toe

Credits
    While I did this entire project solo, I did have help from my mentors and teachers at FullStack Academy for Connect 4.
    For all current games, I did also use online documentation along with ChatGPT to help check over my code for improvement and to catch errors, not to provide any actual coding.
